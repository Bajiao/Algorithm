# Embedding

## Introduction

Embedding refers to the process of converting discrete items (such as words, phrases, or even images) into continuous, numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture the semantic and syntactic properties of the input data so that items with similar meanings or characteristics end up with similar vector representations.

## Key Points

1. **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
   Instead of working with large, sparse representations (like one-hot encoding), embeddings map data into a lower-dimensional continuous space, making computations more efficient.

2. **Semantic Similarity:**  
   In the embedding space, semantically similar words (or other data items) are located closer together. For example, in word embeddings, the words "king" and "queen" might be near each other, reflecting their related meanings.

3. **Learning Methods:**  
   - **Word2Vec:** Learns word embeddings by predicting a word based on its context (or vice versa) within a sentence.
   - **GloVe:** Uses global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus to learn embeddings.
   - **Contextual Embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT):** These models produce embeddings that take the surrounding context into account, so the same word may have different embeddings in different contexts.

4. **Applications:**  
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Embeddings are widely used in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and semantic search.
   - **Retrieval Augmented Generation:** Here, embeddings are used to convert text chunks and queries into vectors that can be compared to retrieve the most relevant information from a database.
   - **Recommendation Systems:** Items (like products or movies) can be embedded to measure similarity and provide personalized recommendations.

## Diagram Illustration

Below is a simple diagram that outlines the embedding process in an NLP context:

## Summary

Embeddings serve as a bridge between human-understandable discrete symbols (like words) and the numerical representations that machine learning models require. By encoding the underlying semantic information, embeddings allow models to perform more effective and context-aware analysis on the input data.
